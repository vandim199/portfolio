    <h2>The Chair</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Our team was assigned to create a sitting VR experience which doesn't
      require controllers in Unreal Engine. <br />
      A variety of concepts were discussed with the team and we settled on a
      horror experience.<br />
      When choosing the concepts I was in charge of researching the performance
      limitations of VR in combination with lumen in order to achieve realistic
      graphics.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Version Control</b> - because of the high filesize of the assets an
      appropriate solution was needed. After researching I decided to use SVN
      hosted on the XR lab computer. SVN also has integration in Unreal allowing
      for easy version control for the artists<br />
      <br />
      I setup a scene, added Lumen and all post-processing effects to set the
      vibe. I also created a shader for the TV to look like an LCD <br />
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/Gallery/lumenvr.png" onclick="openImg(this.src)" />
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/Gallery/tvshader.png" onclick="openImg(this.src)" />
        </figure>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I setup a sequence player in the scene and added functionality for the
      artists like playing sounds, light flickering, etc. <br />
      <br />
      A problem we noticed while testing is that users often missed some of the
      animations. To fix that I added a script to pause the movie until the
      player looks in the general direction and optionally unpauses after a few
      seconds if the user still hasn't looked there. It's easy to use with
      variables to help the artists as much as possible.<br />
      I also implemented some quality of life featureslike resetting the level
      from a button and re-centering the VR view.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Personal Learning Goals</h2>
    <p>
      Since the project wasn't very programming heavy I spent my free time for
      personal development. <br />
      A skill I've been looking to acquire was web development. First I needed
      to learn <b>JavaScript</b> and did exercises.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <img src="images/Gallery/moviedb1.png" onclick="openImg(this.src)" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="images/Gallery/moviedb2.png" onclick="openImg(this.src)" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="images/Gallery/moviedb3.png" onclick="openImg(this.src)" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <img src="images/Gallery/moviedb4.png" onclick="openImg(this.src)" />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After that, I began studying full-stack development, and the project I
      selected for it was an album website that functions similarly to most
      e-commerce websites. It would contain pictures, videos, and quotes from my
      friend group, since we have a lot of funny moments while gaming throughout
      the years<br />
      First I had to do research on what are the most useful frameworks to have
      in my skillset and it became prominent that because of it's popuraity and
      availability of resources React is the way to go. Along with it I used
      Vite to improve loading speeds by bundling all of the site contents
      together and send them to the client with the server. I needed some way to
      store media and the corelated metadata so I opted for MySQL. To handle the
      back-end requests I made a node.js server. The front-end of the website
      sends an API request to the node.js server and it makes a MySQL query to
      get all items, then it would send them to the front-end and create new
      React components for each item. I also wanted to implement filtering - to
      be able to tick a person's name in a checkbox and display all his pictures
      and videos he partakes in.

      <li>
        <img
          src="images/Gallery/albumwebsite3.png"
          onclick="openImg(this.src)"
        />
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This website needed some updating. It didn't work properly on mobile and
      the design wasn't the best so I spent time learning more about website
      design and responsive CSS. I still have work to do but I made some good
      progress. I also got my own domain and I will make it show up in google searches.
